// pseudocode
// There are two gymnastics teams, Dolphins and Koalas. They compete against each other 3 times. The winner with the highest average score wins a trophy!

// BDD
//Your tasks:
// 1. Calculate the average score for each team,using the test data below
// ยง Data 1: Dolphins score 96, 108 and 89. Koalas score 88, 91 and 110
// 2. Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the competition,
// and print it to the console. Don't forget that there can be a draw, so test for that
// as well (draw means they have the same average score)

// Bonus 1 tasks:
//Bonus 1:Include a requirement for a minimum score of 100.With this rule,a
// team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and the same time a score of at least 100 points.
// Hint: Use a logical operator to test for minimum score, as well as multiple else-if blocks 
// Data Bonus 1: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 123

// Bonus 2 tasks:
// Minimum score also applies to a draw 
// !So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 100 points.
// Otherwise, no team wins the trophy
// Data Bonus 2: Dolphins score 97, 112 and 101. Koalas score 109, 95 and 106

// Dolphins average score
const dolphinsAverageScore = (96 + 108 + 89) / 3

// total = 97.7

// Kolas average score
const kolasAverageScore = (88 + 91 + 110) / 3
console.log(kolasAverageScore);
// total = 96.3

// Determining which team won with their score
