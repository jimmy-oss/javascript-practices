JavaScript Fundamentals â€“ Part 1
Coding Challenge #2

Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:
BMI = mass / height ** 2 is = to mass / (height * height) (mass in kg and height in meter).

Your task 1:
1. Store Mark's and John's mass and height in variables.
2. Calculate both their BMIs using the formula(you can even implement both
   versions)
3. Create a Boolean variable 'mark Higher BMI' containing information about
   whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.

Test data:
1. Data 1: Marks weights 78 kg and is 1.69 m tall. John weights 92 kg and is 1.95 m tall.
2. Data 2: Marks weights 95 kg and is 1.88 m tall. John weights 85 kg and is 1.76 m tall.

Your last task:
1. Print a nice output to the console,saying who has the higher BMI.The message is either "Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!"
2. Use a template literal to include the BMI values in the outputs.Example:"Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!"

Hint: Use an if/else statement ðŸ˜‰ GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€
